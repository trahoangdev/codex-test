# Codex Test Repo

## Quick start

- Install deps: `npm install`
- Run dev server: `npm run dev`
- Build: `npm run build`
- Lint: `npm run lint`

## Project layout

- App Router entry: `app/`
- Global styles: `app/globals.css`
- Tailwind config: `tailwind.config.ts`

## Conventions

- Keep edits minimal and scoped to the request.
- Prefer `app/` for UI changes.
